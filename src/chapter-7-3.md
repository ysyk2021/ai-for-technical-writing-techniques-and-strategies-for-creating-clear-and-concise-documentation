Case Studies of Successful AI Implementations in Streamlined Localization and Translation
===========================================================================================================================================================

Implementing AI technology in localization and translation can bring significant benefits such as improved accuracy, faster turnaround times, and lower costs. In this chapter, we'll explore case studies of successful AI implementations in streamlined localization and translation.

Case Study 1: SDL Machine Translation
-------------------------------------

SDL Machine Translation is a cloud-based MT solution that uses neural machine translation (NMT) technology to provide high-quality translations for various content types. By leveraging NMT, SDL Machine Translation achieves a higher degree of accuracy than traditional rule-based MT systems. Additionally, the system allows for customization and training with domain-specific data, further improving translation quality. Through its use, organizations have been able to improve their translation quality while reducing costs and turnaround times.

Case Study 2: Lionbridge onDemand
---------------------------------

Lionbridge onDemand is a platform that provides access to a range of localization services, including translation, editing, and proofreading. The platform leverages AI technology to automate or augment certain tasks, such as language detection, translation memory management, and terminology extraction. By automating these tasks, Lionbridge onDemand is able to reduce costs and improve efficiency, while maintaining high levels of translation quality.

Case Study 3: Unbabel
---------------------

Unbabel is a hybrid human-AI translation platform that combines the speed and efficiency of machine translation with the accuracy and nuance of human translation. The platform uses AI algorithms to pre-translate content before it's passed on to human translators for review and refinement. This approach allows for faster turnaround times while maintaining high levels of translation quality. Additionally, Unbabel's AI algorithms learn from human feedback, continuously improving their performance over time.

Conclusion
----------

Implementing AI technology in localization and translation can bring significant benefits such as improved accuracy, faster turnaround times, and lower costs. By exploring successful AI implementations in streamlined localization and translation, organizations can gain insights into how AI technology can be leveraged to enhance their own localization and translation processes. Additionally, it's important to evaluate data sources, select appropriate algorithms, consider ethical considerations, and monitor and evaluate AI implementations to ensure successful implementation and continuous improvement.
